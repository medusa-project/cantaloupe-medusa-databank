These scripts are invoked by the scripts in the svc_hooks directory, which
in turn are invoked by /etc/init.d/services_startup.

Instead of running them manually, use:

sudo service services_startup start|stop|restart|status

If they are not already registered, first do:

sudo chkconfig services_startup --add
sudo chkconfig --level 345 services_startup on
